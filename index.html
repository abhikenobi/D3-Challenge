          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Average Income and Poverty rates in the United States</h2>
          <p>Usuing census data, a graph was able to be created (shown above) showing the relations betweent the different states'
            average incomes and their poverty rates.
          </p>

          <p>Through just visual observation, it can be noted that there seems to be a strong negative correlation between income and poverty rates.
            Meaning that as a state's averge income increases, their poverty rates seem to decrease. This could be possibly due to the fact that an
            increase in a state's averge income would mean that the state's population as a whole have higher income and outliers like the "1%" are unlikely
            to affect this statistic. This, however, would require further study in order to make this claim definitively as well as study of more datapoints
            such as a state's average cost of living or minimum wage.
